# Atmospheric Turbulence Analysis toolbox
is a set of Matlab functions which build a consistent workflow for a typical analysis of turbulence measurements in the atmosphere, e.g. performed by a research aircraft.

For detailed instructions, please see:
* documentation of the functions by calling `help function_name`
* complete working examples in the form of [Matlab Live Scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/what-is-a-live-script-or-function.html) available in `.mlx`, `.m` and `.html`.

Requires MATLAB R2019b or later at the moment. It is planned to work on backward compatibility.
